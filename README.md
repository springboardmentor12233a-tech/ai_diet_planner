# AI/ML-Based Personalized Diet Plan Generator from Medical Reports

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an AI/ML system that analyzes medical reports containing numeric lab values and textual doctor notes, and generates personalized diet plans based on an individual’s health condition.

The system works by extracting data from medical reports, analyzing it using machine learning and NLP techniques, and converting the insights into actionable diet recommendations.

## Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Milestone Objective
The objective of Milestone 1 is to collect medical data and preprocess it so that it can be used for further machine learning and AI-based analysis.

### Milestone Requirements
- Collect sample medical reports (PDF, text, scanned images)
- Implement OCR for scanned reports and extract text
- Extract structured numeric and textual data from the reports

### Work Done in Milestone 1
- Collected sample medical data including scanned medical reports and a structured CSV dataset
- Implemented OCR using EasyOCR to extract raw text from scanned medical reports
- Identified key health parameters such as glucose, pH, and protein from the extracted text
- Converted the extracted information into a structured key–value format
- Loaded and explored a structured medical dataset (CSV) to understand numeric health attributes

### Outcome
At the end of Milestone 1, raw medical data was successfully converted into readable and structured formats. This establishes the foundation required for further ML-based health analysis and NLP-driven interpretation in future milestones.
