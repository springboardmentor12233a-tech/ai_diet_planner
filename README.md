## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of an internship submission.  
It combines Machine Learning, OCR, and AI-based diet generation to create an intelligent clinical support system.

The system:

- Predicts diabetes risk using trained ML models
- Extracts medical values from prescription images using OCR
- Generates a personalized 7-day diet plan
- Allows PDF export of the generated plan
- Provides a clean, interactive Streamlit UI
