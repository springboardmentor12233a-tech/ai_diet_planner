# Problem Statement: 
Medical reports often contain crucial numeric data (blood sugar, cholesterol, BMI) and textual notes (doctor prescriptions and comments). Patients often struggle to interpret these reports or adjust their diet accordingly. Generic diet suggestions do not account for individual medical conditions. AI-NutriCare aims to analyze patient medical reports, extract relevant information using ML and AI/NLP models, and generate a personalized diet plan that considers health conditions, allergies, and dietary preferences.
