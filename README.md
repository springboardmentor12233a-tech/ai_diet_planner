# AI Diet Planner

**Project Name:** AI Diet Planner  
**Author:** Sabiha Anjum 
**Status:** Under Development  

---

## Overview

AI Diet Planner is an intelligent system designed to generate **personalized diet plans** by analyzing **medical data and reports** using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques.

The project leverages structured medical datasets, image-based data, and OCR pipelines to understand a user’s health condition and recommend suitable dietary plans.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze medical report data (numerical + textual)
- Detect health conditions such as diabetes
- Provide AI-driven, personalized diet recommendations
- Simplify medical data interpretation for users

---

## Key Features

- Personalized diet planning  
- AI-based health recommendations  
- Medical report analysis using OCR  
- Dataset-driven predictions  
- Simple and user-friendly approach
